In general I enjoy problem solving, and data is a great tool to finding solutions to many problems accross many industries. I come from a Life Sciences background, I love the world of research. Working in Biotech is what inspired me to start learning Data Science. The part of Data Science I enjoy the most is the part you get to share with others, cool visualisations that tell a story! .",
